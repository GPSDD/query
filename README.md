# Query Microservice

This repository implements the microservice responsible for the query endpoints of the different adapters.

## Getting Started

**First, make sure that you have the [API gateway running
locally](https://github.com/control-tower/control-tower).**

We're using Docker which, luckily for you, means that getting the
application running locally should be fairly painless. First, make sure
that you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
installed on your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/GPSDD/query
cd query
./query.sh develop
```
